 The Act requires lenders to disclose the cost of the loan to enable consumers to do comparison shopping. The Act also provides for a three-day period in which the consumer may rescind the loan agreement without a financial loss. This provision is intended to protect consumers against unscrupulous lending tactics.3

The Act doesn't dictate who can receive or be denied credit (other than general discrimination standards of race, sex, creed, etc). Nor does it regulate the interest rates a lender may charge.
