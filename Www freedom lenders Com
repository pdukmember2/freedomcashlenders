If a loan was made illegally then you do not actually have to pay back the loan. If a lender does not have a consumer credit license, it is illegal for them to make a loan. It is not illegal to borrow the money, however. Unlicensed lenders are known as loan sharks. Loan sharks have no legal right to claim the money that you borrowed from them, therefore, you do not have to pay the money back.
